Instroduction to Java :-
* Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.
* Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.
Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.

Types of Applications Created using Java :-
        1.  Standalone Application ( also known as Desktop Application or Windows based Application )
                Ex- Standalone Application are Media Player , Antivirus .
                :> AWT and Swing are used to develop Java Standalone apps using Java
        2.  Web Application :-
                :> An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic web page is called a Web application . JSP ,Serverlet, Struts , Sprint , Hibernate , JSF are  the technologies used to develop
                Web Applications in Java
        3. Enterprise Application:-
                :> An application that is distributive in nature such as banking applications   etc. is called  an enterprise application.
                :> It has advantages like High Security , Load balancing , Clustering   . In java EJB is used for creating Enterprise applications.
        4. Mobile Application:-
                :> An application that is created for mobile devices is called mobile Applications  . Android and Java ME are used to create to Mobile Applications.

Java Platforms/Editions :-

        1)  JavaSE ( Java Standard Edition)
                :> It is a java Programming platform. It includes Java Programming APIS ( java.lang , java.io , java.net ,java.util , java.sql ,java.math etc) . It includes core topics like OOPs, String, Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection, e
        2)  Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition)
                :> It is an enterprise platform that is mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications. It is built on top of the Java SE platform. It includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, JPA, etc.
        3) Java ME (Java Micro Edition)
                :> It is a micro platform that is dedicated to mobile applications.
        4) JavaFX
                :> It is used to develop rich internet applications. It uses a lightweight user interface API.



History of Java :-

*   The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of Java starts with the Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was best suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.

*   The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic". Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. James Gosling and his team members started the project in the early '90s.
James Gosling - founder of java

*   Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions, etc. Following are given significant points that describe the history of Java.

        1) James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called Green Team.

        2) Initially it was designed for small, embedded systems in electronic appliances like set-top boxes.

        3) Firstly, it was called "Greentalk" by James Gosling, and the file extension was .gt.

        4) After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project.

Why Java was named as "Oak"? :-

*  Java History from Oak to Java

        5) Why Oak? Oak is a symbol of strength and chosen as a national tree of many countries like the U.S.A., France, Germany, Romania, etc.

        6) In 1995, Oak was renamed as "Java" because it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies.

Why Java Programming named "Java"? :-

*       7) Why had they chose the name Java for Java language? The team gathered to choose a new name. The suggested words were "dynamic", "revolutionary", "Silk", "jolt", "DNA", etc. They wanted something that reflected the essence of the technology: revolutionary, dynamic, lively, cool, unique, and easy to spell, and fun to say.
            i) According to James Gosling, "Java was one of the top choices along with Silk". Since Java was so unique, most of the team members preferred Java than other names.

        8) Java is an island in Indonesia where the first coffee was produced (called Java coffee). It is a kind of espresso bean. Java name was chosen by James Gosling while having a cup of coffee nearby his office.

        9) Notice that Java is just a name, not an acronym.

        10) Initially developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which is now a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995.

        11) In 1995, Time magazine called Java one of the Ten Best Products of 1995.

        12) JDK 1.0 was released on January 23, 1996. After the first release of Java, there have been many additional features added to the language. Now Java is being used in Windows applications, Web applications, enterprise applications, mobile applications, cards, etc. Each new version adds new features in Java.

*   Many java versions have been released till now. The current stable release of Java is Java SE 10.
